# Trading Results Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the repository where I will be sharing the results of my trading strategy. Each month, I will upload my trading returns to provide transparency and track the performance over time.

## Strategy

Although I won't be sharing the specific stock screening tool, I can outline the main elements it incorporates:

- **Earnings Gaps**: Identifying stocks with significant gaps in price following earnings announcements.
- **Volatility Contraction**: Seeking stocks that show signs of reduced volatility before potential breakouts.
- **Trend Following**: Following established market trends to make trading decisions.
- **Volume**: Analyzing trading volume to confirm trends and identify potential trade setups.

## Monthly Reports

- **Frequency**: Results will be uploaded on a monthly basis, typically within the first few days of the following month.
- **Metrics**: Each report will include key metrics such as overall return, individual stock performance, and comparison against relevant benchmarks.

## Disclaimer

The results shared here are for educational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice. The stock screening tool used in this strategy is proprietary and will not be shared.
